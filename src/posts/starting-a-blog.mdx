# Starting a blog!

Welcome to this first blog post. I'm excited to start documenting my journey as a front-end developer.

## Who am I

Hi, I'm Richard van Brunschot. Originally from Eindhoven, NL, but I recently moved to Lommel, BE. While studying Computer Animation/VFX at the Netherlands Film Academy, I specialized in creating high-end 3D models for games and virtual reality.

During my graduation year, I realized that I wanted to focus more on coding and software development. This led me to pursue front-end development, which turned out to be the perfect fit for me.

I'm currently working as a front-end developer at [Trifork](https://trifork.com), where I develop responsive user interfaces using modern technologies such as React, Next.js, TypeScript, GraphQL and SCSS.

## What I'll blog about

Most blog posts will be focused on front-end development and will feature technologies I'm currently working with. But I'll also make sure to write a new blog post whenever I'm experimenting with some new tool or technology. Below is a list of topics that I'll write about first:

- Next.js - API routes
- React - (Custom) hooks, Context)
- JavaScript - 'this' keyword, destructuring
- Styling - SCSS, styled-components, dark mode
- SSR vs SSG vs CSR vs ISR
- (Back-end) validation with yup

## Wrapping up

I'm looking forward to writing the first few blog posts. Check back soon!
